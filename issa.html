<h3><p class="thick">An Overview of the Sport</p></h3>
    <p>
      <div align="center">
      Commonly mistaken as a hobby, swimming has been around for many years, with the
      first record of it being 7,000 years ago. While many people believe that swimming just
      consists of you moving your arms and kicking your legs in the pool, there is much more
      involved within the sport. Your workout, practice level, and diet all come into play
      if you want to be serious about swimming. As a younger swimmer, you do not need the
      advanced workout sessions that older swimmers do. Most swimmers do dryland, which is an on-land workout
      which ranges from exercises to lifting. Exercises are targeted to strengthen different muscles
      while lifting is targeted to bulk you up. For practice level, it varies based on how good you are.
      If you are a higher level athlete, your practice levels are more intense, consisting
      of harder, longer practices that could be higher than 10,000 meters. For a lower level athlete,
      practice could be lower than 3,000 meters with easy intervals for different sets. Each team's practice
      schedule differs and no two teams are the same.
