    <h2>Paul Pogba</h2>
    <p style="color:blue;">
      Paul Labile Pogba (born 15 March 1993) is a French professional footballer who plays </br>
      for Premier League club Manchester United and the French national team. He operates </br>
      primarily as a central midfielder, but can also be deployed as an attacking midfielder,</br>
      defensive midfielder, and deep-lying playmaker.</br>
      Born in Lagny-sur-Marne, Pogba showed much promise as a youngster, flourishing as a member</br>
      of local youth teams. He eventually joined the youth team of Ligue 1 side Le Havre, before</br>
      a protracted transfer brought him to Manchester United in 2009. After beginning his senior </br>
      career with Manchester United two years later, limited appearances persuaded him to depart </br>
      to join Italian side Juventus on a free transfer in 2012, where he helped the club to four</br>
      consecutive Serie A titles, as well as two Coppa Italia and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. </br>
      During his time in Italy, Pogba further established himself as one of the most promising </br>
      young players in the world, and received the Golden Boy award in 2013, followed by the Bravo</br>
      Award in 2014. In 2016, Pogba was named to the 2015 UEFA Team of the Year, as well as the 2015</br>
      FIFA FIFPro World XI, after helping Juventus to the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final, their </br>
      first in 12 years.</br>
      Pogba's performances at Juventus allowed him to return to Manchester United in 2016 for a </br>
      then-world record transfer fee of</p> <p style="color:blue">€105 million (£89.3 million)></p>. <p>The fee paid for him remains the</br>
      highest paid by an English club. In his first season back, he won the League Cup and the Europa League.</br>
      Internationally, he captained France to victory at the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup and took home the</br>
      award for the Best Player for his performances during the tournament. He made his debut for the senior</br>
      team a year later, and featured prominently at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, where he was awarded the Best</br>
      Young Player Award for his performances. He later represented his nation at UEFA Euro 2016 on home soil,</br>
      where he finished as a runner-up, before winning the 2018 FIFA World Cup after scoring in the final.</br>
