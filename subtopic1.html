    <h2>David De Gea</h2>
    <p>
      David de Gea Quintana born 7 November 1990 is a Spanish professional footballer </br>
      who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club Manchester United and the Spain </br>
      national team. Born in Madrid, De Gea began his career aged 13 with Atlético Madrid </br>
      and rose through the academy system at the club before making his senior debut in </br>
      2009. After being made Atlético's first-choice goalkeeper, he helped the team win <br/>
      both the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Super Cup in 2010. His performances attracted </br>
      the attention of Manchester United, which he joined in June 2011 for £18.9 million, </br>
      a British record for a goalkeeper at the time. Since joining United, De Gea has made</br>
      over 300 appearances and won a Premier League title, an FA Cup, a League Cup, three </br>
      Community Shields and the UEFA Europa League. For three consecutive seasons from </br>
      2013–14 to 2015–16, he was elected as United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year, </br>
      the first player in the award's history to win on three successive occasions. In </br>
      2018 he was named in the FIFA World XI. De Gea was the captain for the Spain </br>
      under-21 national team that won the European Championship in 2011 and 2013, and</br>
      also competed in the 2012 Olympics. He made his debut for the senior team in 2014</br>
      and was selected for that year's World Cup. He was tipped by many to become the </br>
      successor to Iker Casillas as Spain's long-term goalkeeper. </br>
